OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The state of the art in developing secure computer systems is
advancing rapidly, with progress in several communities around the
world spanning the software industry, academia, research labs, and
governments.

The Developing Secure Systems Summit (DS3) seeks to establish a new
meeting ground for researchers and practitioners across these
communities. Our goal is to share progress and stimulate further work
on approaches that “build security in” to existing and new computing
systems.

DS3 aims to be an inclusive event, building on several existing
communities to forge its identity. On the one hand, we aim to reach
out to the security research community that congregates at flagship
events like IEEE Security and Privacy, the USENIX Security Symposium,
and the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications
Security. Equally, we seek to connect with the open source and
industrial software security community that gathers around events like
the Linux Security Summits, ShmooCon, BlueHat, and Real World
Crypto. Additionally, we hope to interest others whose works are
underrepresented at existing venues.

DS3 in 2020

For this year, we had initially envisioned a 2-day event hosted at
Microsoft in Redmond. However, in light of the global pandemic we are
aiming instead to first build an online community centered around a
series of virtual seminars, drawing inspiration from several
successful virtual events in the past months.   SCHEDULE

We are announcing now a first round of 7 invited speakers. We will
announce additional events (e.g., breakout sessions and tutorials)
will be announced separately. Further, based on feedback from
participants, we expect to announce a second series of speakers in
Spring 2021.
