Michelle Mazurek is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science
Department and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the
University of Maryland, College Park. Her research aims to understand
and improve the human elements of security- and privacy-related
decision making. Recent projects include examining how and why
developers make security and privacy mistakes; investigating the
vulnerability-discovery process; evaluating the use of threat-modeling
in large-scale organizations; and analyzing how users learn about and
decide whether to adopt security advice. Her work has been recognized
with an NSA Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper award and three USENIX
Security Distinguished Paper awards. She was Program Chair for the
Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) for 2019 and 2020 and
will be Program Chair for the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium
(PETS) for 2022 and 2023.

<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>

Secure development is not just a technical problem: it’s a human and
organizational problem as well. To understand the causes of
insecurity, and find effective solutions, we must understand how and
why security problems happen, and what barriers stand in the way of
fixing them. How can we make it easier for developers to write secure
code, even without special training? In this talk, I will report on
findings from several recent studies addressing these questions. These
include examining the effects of information resources and API design
on developers' likelihood of writing secure code; using data from a
secure programming contest to explore the kinds of security mistakes
developers make; and exploring the benefits and barriers associated
with adoption of a secure programming language.
