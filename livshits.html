<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>
Brave is a web browser that is currently used by over 20 million people worldwide, in part because it blocks third-party advertising by default, improving the end-user privacy and making browser faster. In this talk I will give a broad overview of many research and development efforts in the context of the Brave web browser targeting a reduction in online tracking. Some of the privacy-enhancing are based on research that goes back a decade, while others are a lot more on the "bleeding edge."
