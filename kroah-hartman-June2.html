<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>
        Over the years it turns out that it takes more than just "fixing
        the bugs" to provide good security responses for an open source
        project.  This talk will cover a number of things that the Linux
        kernel security team has had to do in order to help make the
        process of handling security issues and getting the fixes out to
       users quickly and safely.
