<a href="https://mboehme.github.io/">Marcel Böhme</a> is a 2019 ARC DECRA Fellow and Senior Lecturer (A/Prof) at Monash University, Australia. Marcel’s research is focussed on the theoretical foundations and the practical tooling around software security, where he investigates practical aspects of automated vulnerability discovery, such as efficiency, scalability, and assurances. Marcel leads his group with a reproducibility policy. All tools and data are made available as open-source, and in some cases have been upstreamed for integration into popular fuzzers, such as AFL++ and LibFuzzer.
