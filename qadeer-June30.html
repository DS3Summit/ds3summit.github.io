<b>Speaker: Shaz Qadeer</a></b>
<br><br>

Shaz Qadeer works at Facebook.  In addition to the work described in
the abstract of this talk, he also works
on <a href="https://civl-verifier.github.io/">Civl</a>, a reifier for
concurrent programs..  His research interests span all aspects of
development of robust and secure software.

<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>
Move is a language originally designed for programming <a href="https://github.com/diem/diem">Diem</a>,
a peer-to-peer network for replicated computation (also known as a blockchain in some circles).
<br><br>

The Move programming framework provides:
<ol>
<li> a compiler that lowers the code to bytecode, </li>
<li> a verifier that guarantees type and memory safety even in the presence of untrusted code, and </li>
<li> a prover capable of verifying functional correctness of compiled bytecode against deep safety specifications. </li>
</ol>
<br>

This talk will provide an overview of the language, the bytecode verifier, and the prover.
If time permits, I will speculate on new applications for Move.
