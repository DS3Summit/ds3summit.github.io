Herbert Bos is full professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
where he co-leads the VUSec Systems Security group. He is very proud
of his current and former students whose research results have led to
three PWNIE Awards as well as changes in all major operating systems,
all browsers and all Intel CPUs. He is no fan of climate skeptics and
xenophobes. He likes the Beatles.

<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>

This presentation will explain how to create bad threat models (just keep doing what you're doing), why abstractions are the work of the devil (and a necessary evil), and what happens when processor flaws meet traditional software exploitation (nothing good). I will illustrate my arguments with stick figures and an explanation of our recent <a href="https://download.vusec.net/papers/blindside_ccs20.pdf">BlindSide</a> attack.
