Dr. Galen Hunt founded and leads the Microsoft team responsible for
Azure Sphere. His team’s mission is to ensure that every IoT device on
the planet is secure and trustworthy. His team’s work in device
cybersecurity is grounded in evidence-based research published in
Dr. Hunt’s The Seven Properties of Highly-Secure Devices. Previously,
Dr. Hunt pioneered technologies ranging from confidential cloud
computing to light-weight container virtualization, type-safe
operating systems, and video streaming. Dr. Hunt was a member of
Microsoft's founding cloud computing team. Dr. Hunt holds over 100
patents, a B.S. degree in Physics from University of Utah and
Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of
Rochester.

<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>

Five years ago, my research team set out on a mission to make it possible for any device manufacturer to create secure IoT devices. While getting security right is hard in any domain, it is especially hard in the domain of IoT, a domain where a passion to get things done quickly often runs up against the stark realities of the threat landscape of the modern internet. Our imagination and mission were fired by the possibilities of combining new silicon with a new OS and new cloud services to solve IoT security better than anyone before us. While we haven't yet fully achieved our mission of securing every IoT device on the planet, we're traveled far down the path. In the process, we've documented the Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices, built multiple chips, enabled companies such as Starbucks to deploy IoT devices with confidence in their security, and benefitted from multiple red team exercises involving some of the best security researchers on the planet. In this talk, I'll give a quick introduction to IoT for systems people, share what we've learned so far, and share our perspective on the future of IoT security.
