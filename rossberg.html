Andreas Rossberg is a principal researcher and engineer with the
Dfinity Foundation. In an earlier life he was a software engineer at
Google, where he worked on V8, the JavaScript virtual machine. Prior
to his move to industry he was a researcher at the Max Planck
Institute for Software Systems. He is one of the designers of
WebAssembly, authored its formalisation and specification, and is the
champion of various proposals for enhancements. At Dfinity, he is
working on employing Wasm for decentralised cloud computing and is the
tech lead of the languages team. His research interests revolve around
programming languages, ranging from foundational theory, over design,
to implementation techniques.

<b>Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level code format that has seen adoption
in a wide range of execution environments such as the web, mobile,
edge computing, and cloud computing. Because it allows executing
untrusted machine-level code, its design has to take security
considerations into account, putting it into a permanent tension
between performance and safety. In this presentation, we will give an
overview of Wasmâ€™s basic safety and security features, with a focus on
its module system and the sandboxing that can be achieved with it. We
argue that proper modularity is a key ingredient to security, and a
strong and expressive notion of modularity is crucial in expressing
and scaling flexible software architectures securely.
